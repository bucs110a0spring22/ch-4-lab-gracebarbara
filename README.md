## SUMMARY:
 In order to draw a sine function with turtle, I first created a function that uses the math module and a for loop to iterate the angle from -360 to 360 and map out the sine curve. It was then necessary to alter the window of the screen using set world coordinates within a function so that there was more room to plot the values of the sine function. Then, I used another funtion to draw the axis using basic turtle commands within another function. After the sine function, I then added a cosine function and a tangent function by slightly altering the command to fit those functions. Finally, the prewritten main function called to each of the functions and allowed the axis and trig functions to be drawn.
